<h2><A name="1">What is data structure?</A></h2>
<p>In computer science, simply  speaking a <strong><em>data structure is a way of storing data</em></strong> in a computer  so that <strong><em>it can be used efficiently</em></strong>. A data structure is a way of  organizing data that considers <strong><em>not only the items stored, but also their  relationship</em></strong> to each other. Advance knowledge about the relationship  between data items allows designing of efficient algorithms for the  manipulation of data. Often a <strong><em>carefully chosen data structure will allow  a more efficient algorithm</em></strong> to be used. The choice of the data structure  often begins from the choice of an abstract data structure. A well-designed  data structure allows a variety of critical operations to be performed on using  as little resources, both execution time and memory space, as possible. <br />
  Different kinds of data  structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly  specialized to certain tasks. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree" target="_parent" title="B-tree">B-trees</a> are particularly well-suited for implementation of databases, while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" target="_parent" title="Compiler">compiler</a> implementations usually use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table" target="_parent" title="Hash table">hash tables</a> to look up identifiers.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Why data structure is important in computer science?</h2>
<p> Data structures are used in almost every  program or software system. Data structures provide a means to manage huge  amounts of data efficiently, such as large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database" target="_parent" title="Database">databases</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_indexing" target="_parent" title="Web indexing">internet </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_indexing" target="_parent" title="Web indexing">indexing services</a>. Usually, efficient data structures  are a key to designing efficient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms" target="_parent" title="Algorithms">algorithms</a>. Some formal design methods and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" target="_parent" title="Programming language">programming languages</a> emphasize data  structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software  design.<strong> Niklaus Emil Wirth (born February 15, 1934) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" target="_parent" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_parent" title="Computer science">computer scientist</a> said:</strong></p>
<p><strong>            Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs </strong></p>
<h2><A name="2">Basic types of data structure</A></h2>
<p>In programming, the term <em>data structure</em> refers to a  scheme for organizing related pieces of information. The basic types of data  structures include:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>files </strong></li>
  <li><strong>lists </strong></li>
  <li><strong>arrays </strong></li>
  <li><strong>records </strong></li>
  <li><strong>trees </strong></li>
  <li><strong>tables </strong></li>
</ol>
<h2><A name="3">What is algorithm?</A></h2>
<p><strong><em>A formula or set of steps for solving a particular  problem</em></strong>. To be an algorithm, a set of rules must be unambiguous and  have a clear stopping point. Algorithms can be expressed in any language, from  natural languages like English or French to programming languages like FORTRAN.</p>
<ol>
  <li>We use algorithms every day. For example, a  recipe for baking a cake is an algorithm.</li>
  <li>Most programs, with the exception of some  artificial intelligence applications, consist of algorithms.</li>
  <li>Inventing elegant algorithms -- algorithms that  are simple and require the fewest steps possible -- is one of the principal  challenges in programming. </li>
</ol>
<p>The word &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; derives from the name of the  mathematician, Abu Ja'far Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, who was an Arab,  probably from what is now Southern Uzbekistan, who taught at the Caliph's  Palace of Wisdom in Baghdad in the 9th Century, and is one the most important mathematicians  in history. Through Latin translations of his work, al-Khwarizmi introduced to Europe the Hindu-Arabic base 10 numerals - the use of  which came to be known as algorithm in English. </p>
<h2>Algorithm example</h2>

<h2>What are the properties of an algorithm?</h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><strong>Input</strong> - an algorithm accepts zero or more       inputs </li>
  <li><strong>Output</strong> - it produces at least one output. </li>
  <li><strong>Finiteness</strong>        - an algorithm terminates after a finite numbers of steps. </li>
  <li><strong>Definiteness</strong>        - each step in algorithm is unambiguous. This means that the action       specified by the step cannot be interpreted (explain the meaning of) in       multiple ways &amp; can be performed without any confusion. </li>
  <li><strong>Effectiveness</strong> - it consists of basic       instructions that are realizable. This means that the instructions can be       performed by using the given inputs in a finite amount of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Generality</strong> - it must work for a general set       of inputs.<strong> </strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2>How to represent algorithms?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Use <strong>natural languages</strong></li>
  <ol>
    <li>too verbose</li>
    <li>too &quot;context-sensitive&quot;- relies on  experience of reader</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Use <strong>formal programming languages</strong></li>
  <ol>
    <li>too low level</li>
    <li>requires us to deal with complicated syntax of  programming language</li>
  </ol>
  <li><strong>Pseudo-Code</strong> (alias programming language)  - natural language constructs modeled to look like statements available in many  programming languages.</li>
  <li><strong>Flowchart</strong> (diagram) - A <strong>flowchart</strong> is a common type of chart, that represents an algorithm or process, showing the  steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting these with  arrows. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a  process or program in various fields. </li>
